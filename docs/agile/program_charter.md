# RetailOps Intelligence Platform (ROIP)
## Program Charter

---

## 1. Program Overview

**Program Name**  
RetailOps Intelligence Platform (ROIP)

**Program Type**  
Enterprise Data & Analytics Platform Delivery

**Delivery Methodology**  
Agile (Scrum-based, sprint-driven)

**Program Duration**  
Multi-sprint incremental delivery (planned: 6 sprints)

---

## 2. Vision Statement

The RetailOps Intelligence Platform aims to deliver a trusted, scalable, and performance-tested analytics foundation that enables retail stakeholders to monitor inventory health, sales performance, fulfillment efficiency, and returns using a single, governed source of truth.

The program emphasizes production-quality data engineering, disciplined delivery practices, and business-aligned analytics rather than exploratory or demo-style reporting.

---

## 3. Business Problem Statement

Retail organizations often operate with fragmented transactional systems, inconsistent metrics, and limited confidence in analytical outputs. Common challenges include:

- Disparate operational data sources with no unified analytical model  
- Inconsistent KPI definitions across teams  
- Limited data quality validation and auditability  
- Poor performance and unpredictable query behavior  
- Analytics delivered without testing or operational readiness  

These issues reduce decision confidence and slow operational response.

---

## 4. Program Objectives

The objectives of the RetailOps Intelligence Platform are to:

1. Establish a structured data architecture that supports analytical workloads  
2. Deliver consistent, validated operational KPIs  
3. Implement data quality and testing practices as first-class citizens  
4. Ensure acceptable performance for analytical queries and dashboards  
5. Provide business-ready reporting aligned to real retail use cases  

---

## 5. In-Scope

- Retail transactional data ingestion from relational source systems  
- Staging and warehouse-layer data modeling  
- Star-schema-based analytical design  
- Operational KPI calculation (inventory, sales, fulfillment, returns)  
- Power BI semantic modeling and dashboards  
- Data quality validation and negative test scenarios  
- Performance testing and tuning  
- Deployment, documentation, and operational readiness  

---

## 6. Out of Scope

- Machine learning or predictive modeling  
- Real-time or streaming architectures  
- Marketing or customer segmentation analytics  
- UI/UX experimentation or advanced visualization styling  
- Third-party SaaS analytics platforms  

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- Pipelines are repeatable, documented, and test-validated  
- KPIs are traceable to source data  
- Performance benchmarks are defined and met  
- Dashboards reflect warehouse data without manual fixes  
- Artifacts demonstrate production readiness  

---

## 8. Key Stakeholders (Simulated)

- Business (Operations, Finance, Supply Chain)  
- Data Engineering  
- BI / Analytics  
- QA / Data Quality  
- DBA  
- DevOps  

---

## 9. Assumptions

- Relational source systems available locally  
- Sample datasets represent realistic retail scenarios  
- Power BI used for visualization  
- Agile ceremonies followed throughout delivery  

---

## 10. Constraints

- Local (non-cloud) execution  
- Limited infrastructure scale  
- Sample data used as enterprise proxy  

---

## 11. Risks (High-Level)

- Source data availability delays  
- Data quality gaps in samples  
- Local performance constraints  
- Scope creep
